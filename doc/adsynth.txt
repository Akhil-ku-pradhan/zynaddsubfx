Add Synth
=========

Additive Synthesis is one of the three major synthesis engines available in
ZynAddSubFX.
Overall it adds together several voices with an oscillator as their sound
source.

High Level (Global)
-------------------

From a high level perspective, Add synth can be understood with this block
diagram:

The red/yellow nodes are controllable with the main adsynth window.

The sum of the voices are passed through filters and amplification to produce
the final sound.
This could lead one to think that ad-note is just a bunch of minor
postprocessing and at this level much of the sound generation is hidden.
