1) Sometimes when working with banks it crash - don't know why - I tested even with valgrind and I couldn't find out where is the problem (a double delete??)
2) If the same directory is selected twice on bank roots or preset dir., the same files are shown twice and bad things can happen - I must solve this by comparing the directories (they can me relative directories and absolute dirs.)
3) The windows version doesnt sort the bank/presets list
